            <p class="about-me">
                Nearly two years ago I embarked on my coding journey. It all started with a free course 
                offered by Stanford University at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. I stumbled around
                trying to make Karel the robot stop spinning endlessly for hours, as I struggled to figure out how loops worked. 
            </p>

            <p class="about-me">
                I was instantly hooked. I loved how much there was to learn. All the different rabbit holes to go down.
                The freedom to create anything. So I continued studying, learning new languages, creating programs, 
                slowly making them more and more complex. I'd be lying if I didn't at times spend hours frustrated and 
                unable to fix a bug which ended up just being a missnamed variable or a missing bracket. I knew that I was 
                truly passionate about programming and therefore it was something I should pursue as a career rather than just as a hobby.

            <p class="about-me">
                <strong>What are some of my skills and hobbies?</strong>
            </p>

        <!-- Main section -->
            <h3 class="about-me-subtitle">Critical thinking</h3>
            <p class="about-me">
                My Bachelor's degree in History and Master's degree in International Relations taught me to think critically. This skill has been transfered and improved during my programming studies. I have learnt not simply be satisfied by the easiest or first solution to solving a problem, I always question if there is a better solution or whether mine can be improved upon.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-me-subtitle">Teamwork</h3>
            <p class="about-me">
                Having been both a leader and member of various teams, has taught me how to effectively communicate, collaborate, organize and support others in a team environment. Maker's Academy's focus on daily Pair Programming and group projects has also taught not only how to transfer these skills into the world of programming, but also how to work efficiently with a variety of different personalities.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-me-subtitle">Languages</h3>
            <p class="about-me">
                Fluent in English, French, Italian and highly competent in Spanish ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§  ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
            </p class="about-me">
            <p class="about-me"> 
                My ability to learn and speak multiple languages has translated in my programming. Paired with a learning mindset that always looks for improvement, it has created the foundation for me to easily pick up new languages and tools.
            </p>
