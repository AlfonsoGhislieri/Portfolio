# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my first attempt at creating a fully functional website. I decided this would be a good opportunity to create a website that 
could store all of my previous and future coding projects.

I had some previous experience in HTML and CSS but this was my first major personal project working with both.

The website has a main page which contains a short summary, a section for projects to display and a footer that contains media links. Each portfolio also has its own webpage that can be accessed by clicking the relevant image.

The website => https://alfonsoghislieri.github.io/Portfolio/

 ## What I implemented:

- Pop-up menu that opens and closes for user navigation
- Portfolio images that transform and enlarge on hover
- Portfolio images take user to separate webpage on click 
- Separate webpages for each portfolio item
- Footer that allows user to directly email and access media links on click
- Website adapts to different screen resolutions

## Challenges

The main struggle I had to overcome with this project was staying organized with all the different sections and webpages. I had to learn how to effectively use classes in order to keep uniformity for the layout and also make it easier to add to the project in the future. 

Making sure the website would also look good at different resolutions was another issue I encountered. I decided to use the @media rule in order to apply different styles that would adapt at different resoutions.
